This timer is designed to help you focus for a set period, typically 25 minutes of concentrated work followed by a short break.

When the button is not pressed, the dog remains asleep. 
Once you press the button, an animation of a walking dog is displayed, along with a timer bar at the top showing how much time is left.
It also shows the total number of completed sessions so far.

Please note that the timer cannot be paused. The only way to stop it is by unplugging the device. 
You can accuse me for being lazy to not build that function in, but there is a reason behind it!
I found that when I had a pomodoro app, I often paused the timer and that stopped me from being focused.

I became very excited about microcontrollers after learning about them. You can build almost anything!
I had countless ideas for automating tasks around my home, such as an alarm that notifies me when someone opens the mailbox, 
or even a robot to water my plants. Or maybe even a digital plant that doesn’t need watering!

This field is fascinating to explore, with various sensors, buttons, and switches that can be integrated into a microcontroller.

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a compact board that doesn’t run an operating system like other Raspberry Pi models. For this project, I used the programming language MicroPython. 
I am planning on using C in the future because it has an overall better performance.
